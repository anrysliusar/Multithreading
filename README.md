# Multithreading
### Task
Create a file and fill it with some content (lorem ipsum or some article from somewhere, not the essence). Write a LineStorage class that will have a String field. Write a ContentReader class that will read the contents of the file in the stream and write each line to a LineStorage object. Write a ContentPrinter class that will display LineStorage content in the stream. Synchronize streams so that ContentPrinter does not display the same string multiple times.
